/**
 * Represents general layouts for Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) devices on an arbitrary abstraction level.
 * Layouts are always 3-dimensional grid-like structures consisting of faces. Each face is addressed by a 3-tuple
 * (x, y, z) where axis are named intuitively. Numbering starts in the upper left ground layer with (0, 0, 0) and ends
 * in the lower right highest layer with (x - 1, y - 1, z - 1).
 *
 * They can be accessed by operator(x, y, z) or operator[x][y][z], where the former is more performant. Special
 * constants defined above allow for direct access of X-, Y-, Z-coordinate of faces. Assume f is a face. Then f[X]
 * returns its X-coordinate. Works analogously for the other dimensions.
 *
 * Each layout must have a clocking scheme which can be regular or irregular. For regular clocking schemes, a small
 * cutout is used to extrapolate the whole floorplan. Some pre-defined clocking schemes are provided in
 * fcn_clocking_scheme.h. More can easily be implemented there. Irregular clockings are stored in a special map which
 * assigns a designated clock zone to each face.
 *
 * Besides that, special clock latches are available. See docstrings below for a detailed description of how they work.
 *
 * This class is pure-virtual so any concrete implementation can deal with what it means to be a face as well as names
 * via aliases themselves. View this class as a general framework for all kinds of layouts.
