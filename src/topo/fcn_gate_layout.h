/**
 * Represents layouts of field-coupled nanocomputing (FCN) devices on a gate level abstraction. Inherits from fcn_layout
 * so it is a 3-dimensional grid-like structure as well. Faces are called tiles in a gate layout. Tiles can be occupied
 * by either an operation like AND, OR, NOT, fan-outs, special PI/PO ports or buffers (which make the tile a gate tile),
 * or multiple edges (which makes the tile a wire tile). All operations and edges are associated with a logic_network
 * (vertices, edges). Via direction maps, each tile and each wire within can be assigned input and output directions to
 * neighboring tiles to define information flow (in combination with clocking scheme). There are functions available to
 * access and trace those information flows.
 *
 * To iterate over all tiles of a fcn_gate_layout l, use
 *  for (auto&& t : l.tiles())
 *  {
 *      ...
 *  }
 *
 * There are more functions returning ranges of tiles. They work analogously.
 *
 * Sets of primary inputs and primary outputs mark tiles which have special connectors to the outside world. Note that
 * there are designated operations in logic_networks called operation::PI and operation::PO. Assigning those to tiles
 * leads to out-of-gate connectors. Though, also normal gate tiles can be PI/PO by setting the flags in the
 * assign_logic_vertex function. Then, the PI/PO is located directly in the gate. Note that this may or may not be
 * working in real devices depending on the used technological implementation. Note also that this version cannot
 * distinguish between multiple input or output ports so that it leads to errors when using non-symmetric functions as
 * gate-tiles. Though it is no restriction for classical MAJ, AND, OR, NOT, fan-out functions. Technically, PI/POs can
 * also be detected by a lack of input/output connections.
 *
 * It is not necessary (in fact, it leads to errors) to assign constant nodes to MAJ tiles to create AND, OR. Those do
 * have constant nodes inherently and can be assigned to tiles directly. No MAJ needed.
