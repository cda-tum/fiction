/**
 * An exact physical design approach using SMT solving. This class provides the interface via which the technique
 * can be called from the CLI. The instance generation happens in its sub-class smt_handler.
 *
 * Via incremental SMT calls, an optimal placement & routing for a given logic network will be found. Starting with n,
 * each possible layout dimension in n tiles will be examined by factorization and tested for routability with the SMT
 * solver z3. The number n thereby is the lower bound which is equal to the number of vertices in the given logic
 * network. When no upper bound is given, this approach will run until it finds a solution to the placement & routing
 * problem instance under all given constraints. Note that there a combinations of constraints for which no valid
 * solution under the given parameters exist for the given logic network. Recommended settings include the use of
 * I/O pins located at the layout borders for better integration. Most networks are not realizable without crossings
 * enabled. Specifying a clocking scheme SIGNIFICANTLY speeds up the process. 2DDWave allows for the strictest
 * constraints and thereby finds a solution the quickest. However, for high input degree networks, no valid solution
 * exists when border I/Os are to be used unless global synchronization is disabled. Generally, solutions are found
 * the fastest with the following settings: Crossings enabled, de-synchronization enabled, and 2DDWave clocking given.
 * Multi-threading can sometimes speed up the process especially for large networks. Note that the more threads are
 * being used, the less information can be shared across the individual solver runs which destroys the benefits of
 * incremental solving and thereby, comparatively, slows down each run.
 *
 * The SMT instance works with a single layer of variables even though it is possible to allow crossings in the
 * solution. The reduced number of variables saves a considerable amount of runtime. That's why most for-loops iterate
 * over layout->get_ground_layer_tiles() even though the model will be mapped to a 3-dimensional layout afterwards.
