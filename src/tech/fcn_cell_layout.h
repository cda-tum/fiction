/**
 * Represents layouts of field coupled nanocomputing (FCN) devices on a cell level abstraction. Inherits from fcn_layout
 * so it is a 3-dimensional grid-like structure as well. Faces are called cells in a cell layout. Cells can have special
 * types which correlate with their physical behavior. This abstraction level is close to physics. It incorporates FCN
 * technologies from which the gate layout abstracts. fcn_cell_layouts can be created as QCA, NML, DB, etc.
 * implementations for which necessary technologies and cell types can be defined in fcn_technologies.h and
 * fcn_cell_types.h.
 *
 * To iterate over all cells of a fcn_cell_layout l, use
 *  for (auto&& c : l.cells())
 *  {
 *      ...
 *  }
 *
 * fcn_cell_layouts can be constructed in a classical way by assigning types to cells or from a already existing
 * fcn_gate_layout. This can be achieved by constructing a fcn_gate_library, which incorporates the desired layout
 * together with a technology to which the gate layout should be mapped, and passing it to the constructor of
 * fcn_cell_layout. Depending on the chosen tile size and technology, this may fail and throw an exception. For correct
 * use of this technique, see commands.h.
