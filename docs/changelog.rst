- Renamed ``pi``\ /``po_count`` to ``num_pis``\ /``pos``
- ``read`` does no longer substitute fan-outs automatically, ``exact`` and ``ortho`` do it instead if the user did not call ``fanouts``
- ``exact --path_discrepancy/-p`` has been renamed to ``exact --desynchronize/-d`` to express its use case better
- ``exact --timeout/-t`` expects its parameter in seconds instead of milliseconds now

Fixed
#####
- Segfault when using ``ortho -i`` with certain compilers in release mode
- Missing input ports for 3-output fan-out gates in QCA-ONE library
- Wire vertices not handled properly by QCA-ONE library
- Wrong clocking look-up for ``BANCS`` clocking in ``fcn_cell_layout``
- Tile directions when assigning and dissociating multiple edges

- Constant outputs of some benchmark files

Removed
#######
- Submodule ``lorina`` as it is included in ``mockturtle``
- ``verilog_parser.h`` as ``mockturtle`` comes with its own one

- ``operation::BUF``; use ``operation::W`` instead
- ``operation::CONST0``, ``operation::CONST1``, and ``operation::XOR``
- ``operator[x][y][z]`` for ``fcn_layout``\ s as it was slow and therefore not used; use ``face/tile/cell{x,y,z}`` instead
