static const char *__doc_fiction_a_star =
R"doc(The A* path finding algorithm for shortest loop-less paths between a
given source and target coordinate in a layout. This function
automatically detects whether the given layout implements a clocking
interface (see `clocked_layout`) and respects the underlying
information flow imposed by `layout`'s clocking scheme.

A* is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths but
offers better average complexity. It uses a heuristic distance
function that estimates the remaining costs towards the target in
every step. Thus, this heuristic function should neither be complex to
calculate nor overestimating the remaining costs. Common heuristics to
be used are the Manhattan and the Euclidean distance functions. See
`distance_functor` for implementations.

If the given layout implements the obstruction interface (see
`obstruction_layout`), paths will not be routed via obstructed
coordinates and connections.

If the given layout is a gate-level layout and implements the
obstruction interface (see `obstruction_layout`), paths may contain
wire crossings if specified in the parameters. Wire crossings are only
allowed over other wires and only if the crossing layer is not
obstructed. Furthermore, it is ensured that crossings do not run along
another wire but cross only in a single point (orthogonal crossings +
knock-knees/double wires).

In certain cases it might be desirable to determine regular coordinate
paths even if the layout implements a clocking interface. This can be
achieved by static-casting the layout to a coordinate layout when
calling this function:

```
{.cpp}
using clk_lyt = clocked_layout<cartesian_layout<>>;
using path = layout_coordinate_path<cartesian_layout<>>;
clk_lyt layout = ...;
auto shortest_path = a_star<path>(static_cast<cartesian_layout<>>(layout), {source, target});
```

A* was introduced in \"A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination
of Minimum Cost Paths\" by Peter E. Hart, Nils J. Nilsson, and Bertram
Raphael in IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics 1968,
Volume 4, Issue 2.

This implementation is based on the pseudocode from

static const char *__doc_fiction_cell_level_layout =
R"doc(A layout type to layer on top of a clocked layout that allows the
assignment of individual cells to clock zones in accordance with an
FCN technology, e.g., QCA, iNML, or SiDB. This type, thereby,
represents layouts on a cell-accurate abstraction without a notion of
logic functions. Gate libraries can be used to transform gate-level
layouts into cell-level ones. Furthermore, cell-level layouts can be
written to files for various physical simulators like QCADesigner,
ToPoliNano & MagCAD, SiQAD, etc.

In this layout, each coordinate, i.e., clock zone has the dimensions
of a single cell. Clock numbers can, however, be assigned in a way,
that they form larger zones, e.g., of :math:`5 \times 5` cells. These
dimensions can be specified in the constructor. They affect the way,
clock numbers are fetched from the underlying clocked layout.

The de-facto standard of cell-level FCN design is to group multiple
cells into tiles large enough to be addressable by individual clocking
electrodes buried in the layout substrate. Cell-based clocking, i.e.,
clock zones of size :math:`1 \times 1` cells are not recommended as
they are most likely not fabricable in reality.

On the implementation side, this layout distinguishes between `cell`,
`cell_type`, and `cell_mode`. A `cell` is a coordinate, i.e., a
position on the layout where a `cell_type` can be assigned. A
`cell_type` is a concrete variation of a fabricated cell and depends
on the given technology. QCA offers regular and constant cell types
while SiDB only provides regular ones. Cell types can also include
primary input and output cells if they are being treated differently
in a simulator for instance. A `cell_mode`, on the other hand, is a
variation of a cell (thus far only known from QCADesigner) that
provides further attributes like its functionality as a crossing or
via cell.

R"doc(A multi-path signal routing approach based on coloring of edge
intersection graphs as originally proposed in \"Efficient Multi-Path
Signal Routing for Field-coupled Nanotechnologies\" by M. Walter and
R. Wille in NANOARCH 2022.

Given a gate-level layout and a set of routing objectives, this
algorithm tries to fulfill all objectives by routing several conflict-
free wire paths. To this end, a plethora of possible paths are
enumerated in the given layout and an edge-intersection graph of paths
on a grid (EPG) created from them. In an EPG, each vertex represents a
path and each edge conflicts between them. When two vertices are
connected by an edge, they cannot be routed together conflict-free in
the layout. To determine a (maximum) set of routable paths, a vertex
coloring is computed on the EPG. Finally, all vertices that are
colored identically can be routed together. The biggest such set is
applied to the layout.

Multiple parameters can be set to specify the behavior of the
algorithm. For instance, whether crossings should be enabled and
whether a partial routing should be conducted if not all objectives
could be fulfilled. Furthermore, the path enumeration and the coloring
can be parameterized in the first place. By default, all paths are
enumerated for each objective. While this guarantees completeness on
small layouts, it quickly becomes intractable. Therefore, a path limit
can be set that restricts the number of paths to the :math:`k`
shortest. Additionally, for the coloring process, SAT solving is used
by default, which, again, guarantees completeness, but becomes
infeasible rather quickly. However, powerful symmetry breaking is
applied that assists the solving process, e.g., it is known that all
vertices that are belonging to the same objective are forming a
clique, which can be pre-colored. Additionally, lexicographical
orderings are enforced. For a more scalable (yet incomplete) approach,
several coloring heuristics are available, from which can be chosen
(see determine_vertex_coloring).

This function will return `true` if all objectives could be satisfied
or if the partial routing parameter was set. In the case of `true`
being returned, all determined paths have been routed in the given
layout.

The throughput is defined as :math:`\frac{1}{x}` where :math:`x` is
the highest path length difference between any sets of paths that lead
to the same gate. This function provides only the denominator
:math:`x`, as the numerator is always :math:`1`. Furthermore,
:math:`x` is given in clock cycles rather than clock phases because it
is assumed that a path length difference smaller than
`lyt.num_clocks()` does not lead to any delay. Contrary, for any
throughput value :math:`\frac{1}{x}` with :math:`x > 1`, the layout
computes its represented Boolean function only every :math:`x` full
clock cycles after the first inputs have been propagated through the
design. Thereby, all PIs need to be held constant for :math:`x` clock
phases to ensure proper computation.

layout.

The algorithm leverages the concept of a screened Coulomb potential,
where the electrostatic interaction weakens as distance increases. If
a defect at position `p` causes the SiDB layout to be non-influential,
then defects further away from the layout are also likely to have no
influence on the layout's functionality or performance. Conversely,
defects closer to the layout may cause it to fail. This behavior
allows for efficient contour tracing of the transition between
influential and non-influential states.

The process is as follows: 1. **Initialization**: Randomly select
`samples` initial defect positions several nanometers away from the
layout where they are unlikely to influence the layout. 2. **Contour
Tracing**: For each position, perform a defect-aware physical
simulation to identify adjacent positions along the x-axis that
influence the layout. 3. **Contour Following**: Trace the contour of
non-influential positions until the starting point is reached again,
thereby closing the contour. 4. **Repetition**: Repeat steps 1-3 for
multiple initial heights to identify additional contours, since
multiple influential-to-non-influential contours may exist. This
process helps to detect all relevant transitions in the layout. This
algorithm uses contour tracing to identify the transition between
influencing and non-influencing defect positions of the SiDB layout.
It starts by searching for defect locations on the left side
(bounding_box + additional scanning area). The y-coordinate for these
positions is chosen randomly. The number of samples is determined by
the `samples` parameter. Then, the algorithm moves each defect
position to the right, searching for the first last non-influencing
defect position.

The `exhaustive design` is composed of three steps: 1. In the initial
step, all possible distributions of `number_of_sidbs` SiDBs within a
given canvas are exhaustively determined. This ensures exhaustive
coverage of every potential arrangement of ``number_of_sidbs`` SiDBs
across the canvas. 2. The calculated SiDB distributions are then
incorporated into the skeleton, resulting in the generation of
distinct SiDB layouts. 3. The generated SiDB layouts then undergo an
extensive simulation process. All input combinations possible for the
given Boolean function are used to verify if the logic is fulfilled.

The `random design` is composed of four steps: 1. A specified number
of canvas SiDBs (`number_of_sidbs`) are randomly added to the skeleton
layout. 2. The operation status of the layout is simulated based on a
given Boolean function. 3. If the layout is `operational`, it is
returned as the result, and the process terminates successfully. 4. If
the layout is `non-operational`, the process is repeated from the
first step until an operational layout is found.

R"doc(Applies contour tracing to identify the boundary (contour) between
influencing and non-influencing defect positions for a given SiDB
layout.

The algorithm leverages the concept of a screened Coulomb potential,
where the electrostatic interaction weakens as distance increases. If
a defect at position `p` causes the SiDB layout to be non-influential,
then defects further away from the layout are also likely to have no
influence on the layout's functionality or performance. Conversely,
defects closer to the layout may cause it to fail. This behavior
allows for efficient contour tracing of the transition between
influential and non-influential states.

The process is as follows: 1. **Initialization**: Randomly select
`samples` initial defect positions several nanometers away from the
layout where they are unlikely to influence the layout. 2. **Contour
Tracing**: For each position, perform a defect-aware physical
simulation to identify adjacent positions along the x-axis that
influence the layout. 3. **Contour Following**: Trace the contour of
non-influential positions until the starting point is reached again,
thereby closing the contour. 4. **Repetition**: Repeat steps 1-3 for
multiple initial heights to identify additional contours, since
multiple influential-to-non-influential contours may exist. This
process helps to detect all relevant transitions in the layout.

Parameter ``samples``:
    The number of random initial positions used to identify and trace
    contours. Higher values increase the chance of capturing all

the graph is said to be :math:`k`-colorable. The minimum value of
:math:`k` for a graph is called its chromatic number. To determine the

automatically detects whether the given layout implements a clocking

information flow imposed by `layout`'s clocking scheme. This algorithm
does neither generate duplicate nor looping paths, even in a cyclic
clocking scheme. That is, along each path, each coordinate can occur
at maximum once.

If the given layout implements the obstruction interface (see
`obstruction_layout`), paths will not be routed via obstructed
coordinates or connections.

If the given layout is a gate-level layout and implements the
obstruction interface (see `obstruction_layout`), paths may contain
wire crossings if specified in the parameters. Wire crossings are only
allowed over other wires and only if the crossing layer is not
obstructed. Furthermore, it is ensured that crossings do not run along
another wire but cross only in a single point (orthogonal crossings +
knock-knees/double wires).

In certain cases it might be desirable to enumerate regular coordinate
paths even if the layout implements a clocking interface. This can be
achieved by static-casting the layout to a coordinate layout when
calling this function:

```
{.cpp}
using clk_lyt = clocked_layout<cartesian_layout<>>;
using path = layout_coordinate_path<cartesian_layout<>>;
clk_lyt layout = ...;

logic network and a gate-level layout or two gate-level layouts. Since
gate-level layouts have a notion of timing that logic networks do not,
this function does not simply prove logical equivalence but,
additionally, takes timing aspects into account as well.

Thereby, three different types of equivalences arise:

- `NO` equivalence: Spec and Impl are not logically equivalent or one
of them is a gate-level layout that contains DRVs and, thus, cannot be
checked for equivalence. - `WEAK` equivalence: Spec and Impl are
logically equivalent but either one of them is a gate-level layout

proposed in \"An Exact Method for Design Exploration of Quantum-dot
Cellular Automata\" by M. Walter, R. Wille, D. Große, F. Sill Torres,
and R. Drechsler in DATE 2018. A more extensive description can be
found in \"Design Automation for Field-coupled Nanotechnologies\" by
M. Walter, R. Wille, F. Sill Torres, and R. Drechsler published by
Springer Nature in 2022.

Via incremental SMT calls, an optimal gate-level layout for a given
logic network will be found under constraints. Starting with :math:`n`
tiles, where :math:`n` is the number of logic network nodes, each
possible layout aspect ratio will be examined by factorization and
tested for routability with the SMT solver Z3. When no upper bound is
given, this approach will run until it finds a solution to the
placement & routing problem instance.

Note that there a combinations of constraints for which no valid
solution under the given parameters exist for the given logic network.
Such combinations cannot be detected automatically. It is, thus,
recommended to always set a timeout. Recommended settings include the
use of I/O pins located at the layout borders for better integration.
Most networks are not realizable without crossings enabled. Specifying
a regular clocking scheme SIGNIFICANTLY speeds up the process. 2DDWave
allows for the strictest constraints and, thereby, finds a solution
the quickest. However, for high input degree networks, no valid
solution exists when border I/Os are to be used unless global
synchronization is disabled. Generally, solutions are found the
fastest with the following settings: Crossings enabled, de-
synchronization enabled, and 2DDWave clocking given. Multi-threading
can sometimes speed up the process, especially for large networks.
Note that the more threads are being used, the less information can be
shared across the individual solver runs which destroys the benefits
of incremental solving and thereby, comparatively, slows down each
run.

The SMT instance works with a single layer of variables even though it
is possible to allow crossings in the solution. The reduced number of
variables saves a considerable amount of runtime. That's why
`layout.foreach_ground_tile()` is used even though the model will be
mapped to a 3-dimensional layout afterwards. Generally, the algorithm
incorporates quite a few encoding optimizations to be as performant as
possible on various layout topologies and clocking schemes.

The approach applies to any data structures that implement the
necessary functions to comply with `is_network_type` and
`is_gate_level_layout`, respectively. It is, thereby, mostly
technology-independent but can make certain assumptions if needed, for
instance for ToPoliNano-compliant circuits.

This approach requires the Z3 SMT solver to be installed on the
system. Due to this circumstance, it is excluded from (CLI)
compilation by default. To enable it, pass `-DFICTION_Z3=ON` to the
cmake call.

static const char *__doc_fiction_gate_level_layout =
R"doc(A layout type to layer on top of a clocked layout that allows the
assignment of gates to clock zones (aka tiles in this context). This
class represents a gate-level FCN layout and, thus, adds a notion of
Boolean logic. The gate_level_layout class fulfills the requirements
of a `mockturtle` logic network so that it can be used in many of
`mockturtle`'s algorithms. Since a layout has to assign fixed
positions to its gates (logic nodes), most generative member functions
like `create_pi`, `create_po`, `create_and`, etc. require additional
coordinate parameters. Consequently, `mockturtle`'s algorithms cannot
be used to generate gate_level_layout networks. To make the class
compliant with the API anyways, these member functions have their
parameters defaulted but they are, in fact required to create
meaningful layouts.

The following notion is utilized in this implementation: - a node `n`
is an index representing the `n`th created gate. All properties of
said gate, e.g., its type and position, are stored independently and
can be requested from the layout. An empty layout has 2 nodes, namely
`const0` and `const1` as required by `mockturtle`. At the moment, they
are not used for anything meaningful but could be.

- a signal is an unsigned integer representation of a `tile`, i.e., a
coordinate in the layout. It can be seen as a pointer to a position.
Consequently, the utilized coordinates need to be convertible to
`uint64_t`.

- the creation of PIs and POs creates nodes (the latter in contrast to
other `mockturtle` networks) that have a position on the layout.

- the creation of buffers (`create_buf`) creates nodes as well. A
buffer with more than one output is a fanout such that `is_fanout`
will return `true` on it. However, it is also still a buffer (`is_buf`
returns `true` as well). Buffers and wires are used interchangeably.

- each node has an associated gate function. PIs, POs, and buffers
compute the identity function.

- signals (pointers to tiles) cannot be inverting. Thereby, inverter
nodes (gates) have to be created that can be checked for via is_inv.

- each `create_...` function requires a tile parameter that determines
its placement. If the provided tile is dead, the location will not be
stored and the node will not count towards number of gates or wires.

- a node can be overwritten by creating another node on its location.
This can, however, lead to unwanted effects and should be avoided.

- nodes can be moved via the `move_node` function. This function can
also be used to update their children, i.e., incoming signals.

Most implementation details regarding `mockturtle`-specific functions
are borrowed from `mockturtle/networks/klut.hpp`. Therefore,
`mockturtle` API functions are only sporadically documented where
their behavior might differ. Information on their functionality can be
found in `mockturtle`'s docs.

The search space graph starts with an empty layout and then expands it
based on where the first node in a topological sort of the logic
network can be placed. Based on the position of this first node, a
cost is assigned to each expansion based on the position of the placed
node. The vertex with the lowest cost, which is the smallest layout
w.r.t. the cost objective (e.g. area), is then chosen for the next
expansion. This iterative process continues until a leaf node is
found, which is a layout with all nodes placed. The algorithm then
continues to backtrack through the search space graph to find other
complete layouts with lower cost.

Exclusively generates 2DDWave-clocked layouts.

R"doc(The Jump Point Search (JPS) path finding algorithm for shortest loop-
less paths between a given source and target coordinate in a Cartesian
layout. This function automatically detects whether the given layout
implements a clocking interface (see `clocked_layout`) and respects
the underlying information flow imposed by `layout`'s clocking scheme.

JPS was proposed as an optimization of A* for shortest paths and
offers better average complexity on uniform-cost grids that allow
diagonal connections. It uses a heuristic distance function that
estimates the remaining costs towards the target in every step. Thus,
this heuristic function should neither be complex to calculate nor
overestimating the remaining costs. Common heuristics to be used are
the Manhattan and the Euclidean distance functions. See
`distance_functor` for implementations. Since JPS assumes a unit-cost
grid, the use of cost functions together with JPS is not possible.

If the given layout implements the obstruction interface (see
`obstruction_layout`), paths will not be routed via obstructed
coordinates and connections.

In certain cases it might be desirable to determine regular coordinate
paths even if the layout implements a clocking interface. This can be
achieved by static-casting the layout to a coordinate layout when
calling this function:

```
{.cpp}
using clk_lyt = clocked_layout<cartesian_layout<>>;
using path = layout_coordinate_path<cartesian_layout<>>;
clk_lyt layout = ...;
auto shortest_path = jump_point_search<path>(static_cast<cartesian_layout<>>(layout), {source, target});
```

JPS was introduced in \"Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding on Grid
Maps\" by Daniel Harabor and Alban Grastien in AAAI 2011.

Parts of this implementation are based on
https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js.

@note The original JPS highly relies on diagonal paths in the grid
which are not possible in most Cartesian grid-based FCN technologies.
Therefore, this implementation disallows diagonal paths. Consequently,
and due to non-uniform clocking schemes, JPS might perform worse than
A* in terms of runtime. It is recommended to use A* (see `a_star`).

@note JPS does not support wire crossings.

The process begins with placement and routing using a blacklist and

specific tiles. After identifying a valid placement and routing, a
defect-aware SiDB gate design algorithm is applied. This algorithm
designs gates for each tile while accounting for atomic defects. If
the gate design is unsuccessful, the blacklist is updated with the
problematic skeleton-gate pair, and the placement and routing process
is restarted. If the gate design succeeds, the algorithm finalizes the
design and returns the SiDB circuit. This approach ensures that the
circuit remains functional even in the presence of defects.

exact ground state simulations, where :math:`n` is the number of
inputs of the layout. Each exact ground state simulation has
exponential complexity in of itself. Therefore, the algorithm is only

drawing as originally proposed in \"Scalable Design for Field-coupled

can be found in \"Design Automation for Field-coupled
Nanotechnologies\" by M. Walter, R. Wille, F. Sill Torres, and R.
Drechsler published by Springer Nature in 2022.

Via certain restrictions to the degrees of freedom in FCN physical
design, this algorithm achieves a polynomial time complexity. However,
these restrictions lead to an overall approximation of optimal layout
quality within several factors. Therefore, this algorithm produces
valid layouts within a short amount of time, its results are far from
being optimal in terms of area.

The imposed restrictions are that the input logic network has to be a
3-graph, i.e., cannot have any node exceeding degree 3 (combined input
and output), and that the resulting layout is always 2DDWave-clocked.

This algorithm is based on a modification of \"Improved orthogonal
drawings of 3-graphs\" by Therese C. Biedl in Canadian Conference on
Computational Geometry 1996. Biedl's original algorithm works for
undirected graphs only while this modification respects information
flow of directed logic networks. To this end, the edge directions of
the logic network directly used instead of relabeling the edges
according to its DFS tree, ordering the vertices using topological
sorting instead of DFS, and adding an extra placement rule for nodes
without predecessors.

The algorithm works in polynomial time :math:`\mathcal{O}(3|N| + |L|)`
where :math:`|N|` is the number of nodes the given network and
:math:`|L|` is the resulting layout size given by :math:`x \cdot y`,
which approaches :math:`(\frac{|N|}{2})^2` asymptotically.

Hofmann, M. Walter, and R. Wille in NANOARCH 2023
(https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611315.3633247). It can be used to
reduce the area of a given sub-optimal Cartesian gate-level layout
created by heuristics or machine learning. This optimization utilizes
the distinct characteristics of the 2DDWave clocking scheme, which
only allows information flow from top to bottom and left to right,
therefore only aforementioned clocking scheme is supported.

To reduce the layout area, first, gates are moved up and to the left
as far as possible, including rerouting. This creates more compact
layouts by freeing up space to the right and bottom, as all gates were
moved to the top left corner.

After moving all gates, this algorithm also checks if excess wiring
exists on the layout using the `wiring_reduction` algorithm (cf.
`wiring_reduction.hpp`)

As outputs have to lay on the border of a layout for better
accessibility, they are also moved to new borders determined based on
the location of all other gates.

clocked!

R"doc(*QuickExact* is a quick and exact physical simulation algorithm
designed specifically for SiDB layouts. It was proposed in \"The Need
for Speed: Efficient Exact Simulation of Silicon Dangling Bond Logic\"
by J. Drewniok, M. Walter, and R. Wille in ASP-DAC 2024
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473946). It determines all
physically valid charge configurations of a given SiDB layout,
providing a significant performance advantage of more than three
orders of magnitude over *ExGS*
(`exhaustive_ground_state_simulation`).

The performance improvement of *QuickExact* can be attributed to the
incorporation of three key ideas:

1. Advanced Negative SiDB Detection: *QuickExact* efficiently
identifies SiDBs that require negative charges in a physically valid
charge distribution. By pre-assigned them in advance, the search space
is pruned by a factor of :math:`2^k`, where k is the number of found
SiDBs.

2. Dependent SiDB Selection: The algorithm selects a dependent SiDB,
whose charge state is always derived from its n-1 neighbors. This
dependency simplifies the computation process and contributes to the
overall efficiency of *QuickExact*.

3. Gray Code Representation: *QuickExact* employs Gray code to
represent and traverse through all charge configurations. By using
Gray code, only one charge state changes at a time, making the
computation of the local electrostatic potential easier.

Additionally, *QuickExact* also considers global and local
electrostatic potentials, as well as existing defects. This holistic
approach ensures an accurate representation of the physical behavior
of the SiDB layout.

In summary, *QuickExact* combines advanced SiDB charge detection,
dependent SiDB selection, and the use of Gray code to achieve
outstanding performance and enable efficient simulations of SiDB
layouts, even in scenarios where positively-charged SiDBs occur due to
small spacing.

A synchronization element is a clock zone whose clock signal is
altered such that it provides an extended Hold phase of a multitude of
full clock cycles. It thereby stalls information in place and acts as
a latch. Additionally, the pipeline-like behavior of FCN circuits
allows clock zones that act as synchronization elements to transmit
information to every clock number instead of just its consecutive one.

The exploration of synchronization elements further allows for
interesting sequential applications like D Latches built from single
MAJ gates as also proposed in the above publications. However, fiction
does not yet support sequential FCN circuits. Therefore, support for
these applications is limited. It is advised to use synchronization
elements only on wire tiles.

obstructions are strategically inserted into the layout to safeguard
against the inadvertent deletion of standard gates or wire segments
essential for the layout's integrity. Leveraging the obstructed layout
as a basis, A* Search is employed to systematically identify feasible
cuts either from left to right or top to bottom. Subsequently, these

static const char *__doc_fiction_yen_k_shortest_paths =
R"doc(Yen's algorithm for finding up to :math:`k` shortest paths without
loops from a source to a target coordinate. If :math:`k` is larger
than the number of possible paths from source to target, the size of
the returned path collection will be smaller than :math:`k`.

This implementation uses the A* algorithm with the Manhattan distance
function internally.

This function automatically detects whether the given layout
implements a clocking interface (see `clocked_layout`) and respects
the underlying information flow imposed by `layout`'s clocking scheme.
This algorithm does neither generate duplicate nor looping paths, even
in a cyclic clocking scheme. That is, along each path, each coordinate
can occur at maximum once.

If the given layout implements the obstruction interface (see
`obstruction_layout`), paths will not be routed via obstructed
coordinates or connections.

If the given layout is a gate-level layout and implements the
obstruction interface (see obstruction_layout), paths may contain wire
crossings if specified in the parameters. Wire crossings are only
allowed over other wires and only if the crossing layer is not
obstructed. Furthermore, it is ensured that crossings do not run along
another wire but cross only in a single point (orthogonal crossings +
knock-knees/double wires).

In certain cases it might be desirable to enumerate regular coordinate
paths even if the layout implements a clocking interface. This can be
achieved by static-casting the layout to a coordinate layout when
calling this function:

```
{.cpp}
using clk_lyt = clocked_layout<cartesian_layout<>>;
using path = layout_coordinate_path<cartesian_layout<>>;
clk_lyt layout = ...;
auto k_paths = yen_k_shortest_paths<path>(static_cast<cartesian_layout<>>(layout), {source, target}, k);
```

The algorithm was originally described in \"An algorithm for finding
shortest routes from all source nodes to a given destination in
general networks\" by Jin Y. Yen in Quarterly of Applied Mathematics,
1970.

Template parameter ``Path``:
    Type of the returned individual paths.

Template parameter ``Lyt``:
    Type of the layout to perform path finding on.

Parameter ``layout``:
    The layout in which the :math:`k` shortest paths are to be found.

Parameter ``objective``:
    Source-target coordinate pair.

Parameter ``k``:
    Maximum number of shortest paths to find.

Parameter ``params``:
    Parameters.

Returns:
    A collection of up to :math:`k` shortest loop-less paths in
