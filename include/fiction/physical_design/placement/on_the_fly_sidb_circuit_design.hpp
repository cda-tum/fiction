/**
 * This function implements an on-the-fly circuit design algorithm for a defective SiDB surface.
 *
 * The process begins with placement and routing using a blacklist and the `exact` method. The blacklist includes
 * skeleton-tile pairs that are excluded due to collisions between skeleton and neutral defects on specific tiles. After
 * identifying a valid placement and routing, a defect-aware SiDB gate design algorithm is applied. This algorithm
 * designs gates for each tile while accounting for atomic defects. If the gate design is unsuccessful, the blacklist is
 * updated with the problematic skeleton-gate pair, and the placement and routing process is restarted. If the gate
 * design succeeds, the algorithm finalizes the design and returns the SiDB circuit. This approach ensures that the
 * circuit remains functional even in the presence of defects.
 *
 * This methodology is detailed in the paper "On-the-fly Defect-Aware Design of Circuits based on Silicon Dangling Bond
 * Logic" by J. Drewniok, M. Walter, S. S. H. Ng, K. Walus, and R. Wille, IEEE NANO 2024
