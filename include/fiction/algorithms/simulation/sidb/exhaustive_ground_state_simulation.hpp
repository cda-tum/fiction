/**
 * *Exhaustive Ground State Simulation* (ExGS) which was proposed in \"Computer-Aided Design of Atomic Silicon Quantum
 * Dots and Computational Applications\" by S. S. H. Ng (https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0392909) computes all physically
 * valid charge configurations of a given SiDB layout. All possible charge configurations are passed and checked for
 * physical validity. As a consequence, its runtime grows exponentially with the number of SiDBs per layout. Therefore,
 * only layouts with up to 30 SiDBs can be simulated in a reasonable time. However, since all charge configurations are
 * checked for validity, 100 % simulation accuracy is guaranteed.
 *
 * @note This was the first exact simulation approach. However, it is replaced by *QuickExact* due to the much
 * better runtimes and more functionality.
 *
 * @tparam Lyt SiDB cell-level layout type.
 * @param lyt The layout to simulate.
 * @param params Simulation parameters.
 * @param ps Simulation statistics.
 * @return sidb_simulation_result is returned with all results.
