/**
 * The purely constructive *Ground State Space* algorithm is the key ingredient of the *ClusterComplete* exact SiDB
 * simulator that lifts exact SiDB simulation to permit multiple gates in connection. It uses iterative "loop until
 * fixpoint" concepts to prune the simulation search space for not only a flat layout of SiDBs, but rather generalizes,
 * and lifts the physically informed space pruning technique introduced with *QuickExact* to higher order, allowing
 * *Ground State Space* to prune multiset charge state configurations at any level in a cluster hierarchy.
 *
 * The role of the cluster hierarchy is to rank interactions between groups, or clusters of SiDBs that together make up
 * the whole layout, such that the variation in electrostatic potential under different charge state assignments is
 * highest between the children clusters of clusters that low in the hierarchy. Thereby, the structure allows us to
 * consider the most charge state assignment-dependent interaction in a more detailed physically informed space pruning
 * analysis, enabling high pruning efficacy for the few pruning tests (with respect to the exponential search space).
 *
 * Starting at a clustering of all singleton clusters, the charge spaces, ie. a set of multiset charge configurations
 * (initially { {{-}}, {{0}}, {{+}} } or omitting the singleton multiset {{+}} in the case of base 2 pre-simulation),
 * are pruned iteratively through potential bound analysis. Through merges, ie., replacing a set of children in the
 * clustering with their parent, we may inspect the most crucially dependant interactions in the layout separately. The
 * procedure finishes when the charge spaces have been folded all the way up to the top cluster, parent of all, which
 * then contains all information resulting from the construction. *ClusterComplete*, without much trickery, now simply
 * unfolds this result, allowing simulation of problems that were previously seen as astronomical, due to the
 * (base 2 or 3) exponential growth in the number of SiDBs.
 *
 * @tparam Lyt SiDB cell-level layout type.
 * @param lyt Layout to construct the *Ground State Space* of.
 * @param params The parameters that *Ground State Space* will use throughout the construction. The physical parameters
 * that *Ground State Space* will use to prune simulation search space are stored in there. In particular, the user may
 * configure parameters that decide limits on the problem sizes of pruning by validity witness partitioning. By default,
 * these are set to avoid runtimes from being affected, as these sub-problems may scale factorially. Thereby, these
 * parameters are especially useful for large simulation problems that could benefit from extra intensive pruning before
 * *ClusterComplete* unfolds the constructed hierarchical charge space.
 * @return The results of the construction, which include the top cluster which parents all other clusters, and thereby
