/**
 * *ClusterComplete* is an instantiation of a general solution to exhaustive state assignment searching for which all

 * interactions. Applied to the problem of exact physical simulation of SiDBs, it is able to efficiently consider
 * positive charges that are rare to occur, but drastically blow up exact simulation runtimes when hierarchical pruning
 * methods are not applied. In fact, the exponential growth in problem complexity for added SiDBs is tamed by
 * *ClusterComplete*, as SiDB layouts to simulate in practise amount to a high pruning efficacy, resulting in a
 * layout-dependent reduction of the simulation base. This amounts to an effective simulation base in the real number
 * range \f$[1,b]\f$, where \f$b\in\{2,3\}\f$ is the given simulation base.
 *
 * The part of the *ClusterComplete* algorithm that is implemented in this file is the destructive phase of the
 * procedure that employs the duality of construction and destruction, folding and unfolding. The phase preceding it is
 * the key ingredient to the achieved efficiency: the *Ground State Space* algorithm, which constructs a minimized
 * hierarchical search space of charge configurations that adhere to the critical population stability criterion. In
 * particular, it generalizes physically informed space pruning that contributes to the capabilities of the *QuickExact*
 * simulator, now applying to all charge states equally, and, most importantly, it lifts the associated potential
 * equations to higher order, allowing us to reason over potential bounds in a cluster hierarchy.
