/**
 * This alias represents a black list of gates that cannot be placed on certain positions on a (layout) surface in
 * certain rotations. The type is just a map of tile positions to another map that associates gate functions with port
 * lists. The second map ensures that each gate function stays unique while the port lists represent the black listed
 * gate rotations.
 *
 * An empty port list vector means that the gate cannot be placed on the associated tile position AT ALL. This notion is
 * to be used preferably as it, e.g., helps the exact physical design algorithm to convert these assertions into unit
 * clauses which significantly helps runtime.
